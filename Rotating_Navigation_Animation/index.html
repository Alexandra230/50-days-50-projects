        <p>
          is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade
          jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride
          of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in
          four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence
          to protect and train strong young allies.

        <p>
          Satoru is a tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered relatively
          attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes,
          which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold
          which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual
          look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.
